The policeman took her to the Nuneaton and Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary, a place founded and run by Geoff Grewcock to care for sick and injured animals. And so an act of fate would change the life of not only a dog and a person, but hundreds of other animals as well.

"When I first met Jasmine, you could tell she had been emotionally devastated but was a gentle dog by nature," Grewcock said. "And soon, she started nurturing the other animals."

Jasmine became famous for playing mother over the years to puppies, foxes, a fawn, 4 badger cubs, 15 chicks, 8 guinea pigs, 15 rabbits, a deer—and one of her favorites, a goose.

<p>A little enthusiasm can take you far—in the case of Pearl the black lab, all the way from a California pound to Haiti.

At the animal shelter, a group that trains seeing-eye dogs saw promise in her. Then they got to know her.

"Halfway through testing her, the rescue said, 'This dog is way too hyper,'" said Pearl's owner and handler, Los Angeles firefighter Captain Ron Horetski.
